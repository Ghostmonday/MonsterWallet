# Trash Directory

This directory is designated for:
- Dead code that has been refactored out but might be needed for reference.
- Unfinished implementations that are not ready for the main codebase.
- Deprecated mocks or stubs.

**Instructions for Future Agents:**
If you find code that is no longer used but too complex to delete immediately (due to potential reference value), move it here.
